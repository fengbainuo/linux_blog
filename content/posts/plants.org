* Relax

I found a good way to relax is to "work" on some small plants. It doesn't take longer than 30 minutes a week to cut off some dry leaves, clean the pot and water them, but they are a joy to look at 24/7.

I currently have a Jade Plant, and Aloe Vera and some type of small cactus that I just recently replanted after it survived literal years in a virtually empty pot.

My Aloe Vera looks a bit unhealthy with heavily drooping outer leaves, but I'll get it in shape next week.

I also should probably replant the Jade Plant soon, I feel like it can't grow properly in the small pot it came in.
